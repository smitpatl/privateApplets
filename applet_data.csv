title,Aquarium Capacity
question_text,"An aquarium tank is 60 cm long, 30 cm wide, and 45 cm high. If water fills 80% of the tank's volume, how many liters of water are in the tank? (Note: 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters)"
given_1,Calculate the total volume of the aquarium in cubic centimeters (V = l × w × h)
given_2,Find 80% of the total volume
given_3,Convert the volume from cubic centimeters to liters
tofind_1,Understand how to convert between different units of volume
tofind_2,Apply volume formulas to solve real-world problems
tofind_3,Visualize how liquid volume transforms between different containers
compute_step_1,Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the aquarium in cubic centimeters (V = l × w × h)
compute_step_2,"V = 60 cm × 30 cm × 45 cm = 81,000 cm³"
compute_step_3,Step 2: Find 80% of the total volume
compute_step_4,"Volume of water = 81,000 cm³ × 0.8 = 64,800 cm³"
compute_step_5,Step 3: Convert the volume from cubic centimeters to liters
compute_step_6,"64,800 cm³ ÷ 1000 = 64.8 liters"
compute_step_7,
compute_step_8,
compute_step_9,
check_step_1,Verify your calculations by substituting the values
check_step_2,"Check: V = 60 × 30 × 45 = 81,000 cm³"
check_step_3,"Check: 81,000 × 0.8 = 64,800 cm³"
check_step_4,"Check: 64,800 ÷ 1000 = 64.8 liters"
check_step_5,Consider if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem
check_step_6,
connect_step_1,First calculate the total volume of the tank using the dimensions
connect_step_2,"Since the water fills only 80% of the tank, multiply the total volume by 0.8"
connect_step_3,Convert from cubic centimeters to liters by dividing by 1000
connect_step_4,The final answer represents the actual volume of water in standard units
