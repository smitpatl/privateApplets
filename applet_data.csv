title,Measurement Conversion Volume Challenge
question_text,"An aquarium tank is 60 cm long, 30 cm wide, and 45 cm high. If water fills 80% of the tank's volume, how many liters of water are in the tank? (Note: 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters)"
given_1,Calculate the total volume of the aquarium in cubic centimeters (V = l × w × h)
given_2,nd 80% of the total volume
given_3,nvert the volume from cubic centimeters to liters
tofind_1,Understand how to convert between different units of volume
tofind_2,ply volume formulas to solve real-world problems
tofind_3,sualize how liquid volume transforms between different containers
compute_step_1,Step 1: Calculate the volume of the original shape
compute_step_2,Step 2: Calculate the total volume of the aquarium in cubic centimeters (V = l × w × h)
