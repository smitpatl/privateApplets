MATH CONCEPT PROMPT
--------------------

GRADE LEVEL: 5th grade

CONCEPT: Volume conservation when a shape changes form

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
- Understand that volume remains constant even when a shape changes
- Apply the volume formula for rectangular prisms
- Solve multi-step problems involving volume

QUESTION/PROMPT:
A box with dimensions 4 cm × 6 cm × 8 cm is melted down and reformed into a cube. What is the length of each side of the new cube?

HINTS FOR SOLUTION:
- Calculate the volume of the original box (V = l × w × h)
- Set up an equation where the volume equals the cube of the side length (V = s³)
- Find the cube root of the volume to determine the side length

CONNECT QUESTIONS:
1. When a shape is transformed into another shape, what remains the same?
   CORRECT: The volume
   WRONG: The surface area
   WRONG: The dimensions
   WRONG: The shape

2. To find the side length of a cube with a known volume, which operation do you perform?
   CORRECT: Find the cube root of the volume
   WRONG: Divide the volume by 3
   WRONG: Square the volume
   WRONG: Multiply the volume by 3

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Students often struggle with understanding that volume is conserved when shapes change. This visualization should show the original box transforming into the cube, with the volume remaining the same throughout. The step-by-step solution should clearly demonstrate the calculation process.
