Sarah has 3 boxes of crayons. Each box contains 15 crayons. She decides to give the same number of crayons to each of her 5 friends. How many crayons does each friend get?

Hint:

First, find out how many crayons Sarah has in total.
Then, divide that number by the number of friends she is giving them to.
Solution:

Calculate the total number of crayons:
[
3 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ crayons per box} = 45 \text{ crayons}
]

Divide the total number of crayons by the number of friends:
[
\frac{45 \text{ crayons}}{5 \text{ friends}} = 9 \text{ crayons per friend}
]

Therefore, each friend gets 9 crayons
