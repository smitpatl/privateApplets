Tom has a rectangular garden that measures 8 meters in length and 6 meters in width. He wants to put a fence around the entire garden. How many meters of fencing does Tom need?

Hint:

Find the perimeter of the rectangle, which is the total distance around the garden.
Solution:

Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:
[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
]

Substitute the given values:
[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (8 \text{ meters} + 6 \text{ meters}) = 2 \times 14 \text{ meters} = 28 \text{ meters}
]

Tom needs 28 meters of fencing to go around his garden.
